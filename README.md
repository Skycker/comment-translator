comment_translator
==================

Quite a small applications allows to localize comments quickly. The tool is dedicated to my friend who gets angry when I write comments not in English. 

###How to use it
Simply run *py_comment_translator.py* file.

While it works only with python codes. File->Open and choose file with code you want to localize. If you use Windows  create .txt file, copy your code there and choose exactly .txt to avoid problems(after translation just rename .txt into .py). If you use Linux be carefree and choose any .py file you wish. 

After openning current comment is shown in lefl text box. Write smth into right tex box and press "Change". It will replace comment into text you've just typed. Write only translation! '#' and triple quotes will be added automatically.

The tool doesn't make any changes in choosen file. Do not forget to save results in a new file!

###Requirements
Python3 interpreter and PyQt4 should be installed.
